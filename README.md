The Spa Appointment Booking System is designed to streamline the booking and management of spa services for customers seeking relaxation and wellness treatments. 
Initially, the system will focus on spa locations in major Houston, Dallas, and Austin. 
During the pilot phase, the system will be avail for Windows-based and Linux-based clients. 
This includes browsing available spa services and reserving appointments. 
In future phases, the system will transition to a web-enabled application.
